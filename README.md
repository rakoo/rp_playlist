A little utility to fetch Radio Paradise's title and output it on
stdout.

Built with go; to install it, run the usual

```shell
> go get github.com/rakoo/rp_playlist
```

Best used with some utility that displays stuff based on what it reads
on stdin, such as
[i3bar](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar) or
[bar](https://github.com/raedwulf/bar/tree/xft-full-utf8) or even
[multitail](http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/)
